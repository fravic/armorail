		 * <ul>
		 * <li>Adding a point and a vector produces a point. Adding two vectors produces 
		 * a vector. Points can't be added together.</li>
		 * <li>Subtracting a vector from a point produces a point. Subtracting a vector 
		 * from a vector produces a vector. Subtracting a point from a point produces
		 * the vector from one point to the other. A point can't be subtracted from 
		 * a vector.</li>
		 * <li>Matrix transformations on vectors don't apply the translation elements.
		 * Matrix transformations on points do apply the translation elements.</li>
		 * <li>In 3D graphics, when a point is transformed to canera space, the w coordinate 
		 * represents the projection transform for projectinbg the point onto the 
		 * projecction surface.</li>
